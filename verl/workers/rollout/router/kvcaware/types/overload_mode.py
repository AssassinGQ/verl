"""Sticky-overload check mode.

``is_overloaded`` decides whether the sticky short-circuit sends a returning
session back to its bound replica (``memory_overload_filter=True``) or falls
back to combined scoring. The mode is independent of ``slow_cut`` so the
overload signal can be chosen without coupling to the routing strategy.

Canonical YAML strings (``simple`` / ``blended``) are mapped to these
constants at the config boundary (``KVCAwareStrategyConfig``).
